# React Project - Hooks-React
### Welcome to the React project repository, a static page containing 10 cards, each with a hook and its respective functionality.

#### Here are the hooks used in this project:

- > useState: Allows adding state to functional components.
- > useContext: Facilitates data sharing between components without the need to manually pass props.
- > useReducer: Manages complex states and updates in a more structured way.
- > useCallback: Memorizes functions to avoid unnecessary re-creations during re-renders.
- > useMemo: Memorizes computed values to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
- > useRef: Provides a mutable reference that persists between re-renders.
- > useImperativeHandle: Allows customizing the value exposed by a parent component when used in conjunction with ref.
- > useLayoutEffect: Similar to useEffect, but synchronous and runs before the screen update.
- > useDebugValue: Allows customizing the value shown for a custom hook in DevTools.
